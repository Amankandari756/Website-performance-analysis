## 📌 Overview

This analysis explores:

- When users are most active (hourly trends)
- How engaged users are (session quality)
- Which traffic sources convert best (based on engagement rate)

## 🧠 Key Insights

- **Direct traffic** is the most valuable—highest volume and most engaged.
- **Organic Social** brings traffic but needs improved landing experience.
- **Referral and Email** traffic sources underperform in user engagement.
- Engagement tends to peak during **afternoon and evening hours**.
- Higher session counts don't always mean higher engagement—**volume ≠ quality**.
